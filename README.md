## Repository name: Pokedex

### Mode: 
Team of 3 or 4 people

### Type of Challenge:
Consolidation

### Duration:
5 days

## Team:
Zahra, Nathanaël, Dzheylyan, Stacy

## Learning Objectives:
1. **PHP Procedural Programming:** Develop proficiency in PHP procedural programming by building a functional Pokedex application.
2. **Database Integration:** Learn to interact with a database to store and retrieve user information, favorite Pokemon, and Pokemon details.
3. **User Authentication:** Implement a secure login and registration system to allow users to save their favorite Pokemon.
4. **Dynamic Web Pages:** Understand how to create dynamic web pages that display a list of Pokemon and their details based on user interactions.

## Your Mission:
Develop a Pokedex application using PHP procedural programming. The application should have an `index.php` page displaying a list of Pokemon. Users should be able to click on a Pokemon to view its details and evolution. Additionally, implement a user authentication system with a login and registration page, allowing users to save their favorite Pokemon.

### Must Have:
#### Index Page (`index.php`):
- Display a list of Pokemons (with pagination).
- Clicking on a Pokemon should lead to a details page.

#### Details Page:
- Show information about the selected Pokemon.
- Display the Pokemon's evolution details.

#### User Authentication:
- Implement a secure login and registration system.
- Allow users to save and view their favorite Pokemon.

### Nice to Have:
#### Admin Dashboard:
- Create an admin dashboard accessible only to administrators.
- Allow admins to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Pokemon in the Pokedex.

#### User Profiles:
- Enable users to create profiles with additional information (avatar, bio, etc.).

#### Search Functionality:
- Implement a search feature on the index page for users to find specific Pokemon.

### Notes Before Starting the Project:
- Do not use JavaScript for calling PHP functions (AJAX) except for the favorite feature.
- You can use or not the base folder, it is up to you.
- You can use a front-end framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

## Resources:
- MVC in PHP
